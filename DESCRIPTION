Description: 'finalproject' is a small R package designed to simplify setup for students in SDS courses at Smith College.
It provides a single function, load_sds(), that loads all the necessary packages for a given class (like "sds_100" or "sds_291"),
with the option to install any that are missing.
Itâ€™s a quick way to get started without worrying about which packages to load.
